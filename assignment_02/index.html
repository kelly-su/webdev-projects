            <h2>Why I Love Cafe Hopping</h2>
            <p>Cafe hopping allows me to explore new spaces, enjoy different atmospheres, and discover new flavors around the USC area. Whether it’s finding a hidden gem with an artisanal brew or experiencing the distinct vibe of each cafe, I love how each visit feels like a mini-adventure. It’s also a fantastic way to support local businesses while enjoying quality time with friends or catching up on some work.</p>
            <p>I personally love trying out new cafes to taste their signature drinks, as well as bringing a friend along to study or collaborate on projects. There’s something comforting about being in a warm, inviting space with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, whether I’m looking for inspiration, focusing on classwork, or just having a laid-back conversation.</p>

            <h2>How to Plan the Perfect Cafe Date</h2>
            <p>If it’s your first time searching for cafes, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> or <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>. These platforms let you explore menus, see photos of the space, and review important details such as location, ambiance, seating options, and parking availability. Reviews provide insights into what drinks or dishes are popular and give you a sense of what other customers love or avoid.</p>
            <p>For USC students, there’s no shortage of accessible cafe options! While a few cafes are within walking distance of campus, many of the more popular spots are located in Koreatown. If you have a car, it’s about a 20-30 minute drive depending on traffic, though street parking might be required. Alternatively, the Metro is a great option for getting from campus to Koreatown. It’s a convenient way to explore new cafes whenever you have some downtime between classes.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Cafes and What to Try</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Drinks -> DAMO</strong>: Known for its premium matcha and expertly crafted coffee and tea. The cafe’s aesthetic is Instagram-worthy, though seating is limited due to its growing popularity. My personal favorite is the latte einspanner, a rich and creamy delight. For matcha lovers, their matcha latte is a must-try!</li>
                <li><strong>Best Studyability -> COIN DE RUE Bakery and Cafe</strong>: This cozy spot offers ample seating and a mouthwatering array of baked goods. Their black sesame latte and red bean pastry are my top picks—both are balanced in flavor, neither too sweet nor too heavy. With its peaceful atmosphere, it’s the perfect place to settle in for a productive study session.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Ambiance -> Coffee MCO</strong>: With a spacious interior and charming outdoor seating, Coffee MCO is an ideal spot to relax or work. The decorations give off a laid-back yet stylish vibe, and their playlist is always on point. I’m a fan of their Mason latte, and their food menu is equally enticing. Plus, they have a dedicated parking lot, which is a rare find in Koreatown!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The cafe scene in Los Angeles is ever-evolving, so there’s always something new to experience. Whether you’re looking for the best drinks, study spots, or just a place with great vibes, there’s something for everyone around LA!</p>
