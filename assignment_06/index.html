                <h2>Why I Love Cafe Hopping</h2>
                <p class="bodoni-moda">Cafe hopping allows me to explore new spaces, enjoy different atmospheres, and discover new flavors around the USC area. Whether it’s finding a hidden gem with an artisanal brew or experiencing the distinct vibe of each cafe, I love how each visit feels like a mini-adventure. It’s also a fantastic way to support local businesses while enjoying quality time with friends or catching up on some work.</p>
                <p class="bodoni-moda">I personally love trying out new cafes to taste their signature drinks, as well as bringing a friend along to study or collaborate on projects. There’s something comforting about being in a warm, inviting space with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, whether I’m looking for inspiration, focusing on classwork, or just having a laid-back conversation.</p>

                <h2>How to Plan the Perfect Cafe Date</h2>
                <p class="bodoni-moda">If it’s your first time searching for cafes, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> or <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>. These platforms let you explore menus, see photos of the space, and review important details such as location, ambiance, seating options, and parking availability. Reviews provide insights into what drinks or dishes are popular and give you a sense of what other customers love or avoid.</p>
                <p class="bodoni-moda">For USC students, there’s no shortage of accessible cafe options! While a few cafes are within walking distance of campus, many of the more popular spots are located in Koreatown. If you have a car, it’s about a 20-30 minute drive depending on traffic, though street parking might be required. Alternatively, the Metro is a great option for getting from campus to Koreatown. It’s a convenient way to explore new cafes whenever you have some downtime between classes.</p>
